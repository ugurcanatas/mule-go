# Mule (GO)

A CLI tool for running simulator commands written with Golang.

When developing mobile application with React Native or presumably with Flutter, there could be multiple simulators/emulators installed on your machine.

This tool is created to basically run certain commands by selecting the exact emulator.

### IMPORTANT

The tool itself only works on macOS currently and not other operating systems.
